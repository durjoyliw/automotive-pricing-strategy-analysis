# Automotive Market Segmentation Analysis - Pricing Strategy & Feature Optimization

## Business Context  
In this portfolio analysis, I examined automotive market and pricing data from the perspective of a Business Analyst at an automotive market research firm supporting the Product Strategy and Sales teams' decisions regarding market positioning, feature prioritization, and pricing optimization for OEM clients.

## Business Question
**Primary Question:** Which vehicle features and market segments drive the strongest price premiums and customer value, and where are the opportunities for competitive positioning?

## Key Business Metrics Analyzed
- **Price Performance:** MSRP analysis across vehicle segments and feature combinations
- **Fuel Efficiency Value:** MPG impact on pricing and market positioning  
- **Feature Premium:** Engine specifications, body style, and luxury feature pricing correlation
- **Market Segmentation:** Performance characteristics by price tier and target customer

## Executive Summary
- **Fuel efficiency** commands 15-25% price premium in compact and mid-size segments
- **Engine performance** features show diminishing returns above 200HP in mass market vehicles
- **Body style preferences** create $3,000+ pricing opportunities in crossover/SUV categories

## Key Business Insights

### 1. Fuel Efficiency Drives Premium Pricing Across Segments
**Finding:** Vehicles achieving 30+ MPG command 15-25% price premiums in their respective categories
**Business Impact:** Clear market validation for hybrid and efficient engine investment, worth $2,000+ per vehicle
**Recommendation:** Partner with Engineering teams to prioritize fuel efficiency features in next-generation platform development

### 2. Performance Features Show Market Saturation Above Mid-Tier
**Finding:** Engine performance above 200HP shows minimal price premium correlation in non-luxury segments  
**Business Impact:** Over-engineering performance may increase costs without proportional revenue benefit
**Recommendation:** Optimize engine specifications for cost efficiency rather than maximum performance in mass market vehicles

### 3. Crossover/SUV Body Styles Command Highest Market Premiums
**Finding:** SUV and crossover configurations average $3,000+ premium over sedan equivalents with similar features
**Business Impact:** Platform allocation toward SUV/crossover maximizes revenue per unit sold
**Recommendation:** Work with Product Planning to accelerate SUV platform development and phase down sedan production

## Strategic Impact & Next Steps
Analysis provides roadmap for automotive portfolio optimization:
1. **Platform strategy** focused on fuel-efficient SUV/crossover development
2. **Feature optimization** balancing performance with cost efficiency  
3. **Pricing strategy** leveraging fuel efficiency and body style premiums
